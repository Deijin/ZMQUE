ZMQUE: ZMQ for UE4
========================================================================


This project was built during a rapid prototyping push, so it exists as
a quick-and-dirty interface. There was no thought to efficiency or
elegance. There are just pass-through functions and the minimum that
is required to call every zmq function in the library.

This is not completely tested. Only the basic calls are in use.
